Everything you do in CSS follows the form:


Selector {
             Property: Value;
            }



A good understanding of CSS Selectors is instrumental to a good CSS grasp.


1. UNIVERSAL SELECTOR (*): The first selector we're going to look at is the universal selector. 
It selects everything in a document. Colt is not sure it's a good thing to do, especially because there are 
relatively better alternatives, according to Colt. 

So, if you want all the colors to be dark


* {
    colors: black;
}

Although this will select every image, text, and everything that may not even need a color change, and try to
force it into color black - like all the divs, and containers, etc.


or all backgrounds to be blue:

* {
    background-color: blue;
}



*******************************************************************************************************************

The next selector is the element selector. 

We've already seen this. It selects all thing of a given type.

ELEMENT SELECTOR

//select all images

img {
    width: 100px;
    height: 200px;
}



--------------------


SELECTOR LIST
An interesting feature of CSS, is that you can use a comma (,) to seperate multiple elements.

h1, h2 {
    color: white;
}
